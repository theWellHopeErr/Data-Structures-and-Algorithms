# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
This repository contains materials and solutions for [Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms "Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization"), created by UC San Diego and Higher School of Economics in Coursera.

1. [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://github.com/theWellHopeErr/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/1.%20Algorithmic%20Toolbox)

      The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. We will learn a lot of theory: how to sort data and how it helps for searching; how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively; when it makes sense to proceed greedily; how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies. You will practice solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second).

2. Data Structures

      A good algorithm usually comes together with a set of good data structures that allow the algorithm to manipulate the data efficiently. In this course, we consider the common data structures that are used in various computational problems. You will learn how these data structures are implemented in different programming languages and will practice implementing them in our programming assignments. This will help you to understand what is going on inside a particular built-in implementation of a data structure and what to expect from it. You will also learn typical use cases for these data structures.
